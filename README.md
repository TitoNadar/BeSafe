# BeSafe

**BeSafe** is an Android Application in the human security domain, Which triggers the app to it's panic mode with just **3 shakes** of the device. As the app triggers the panic,
- A push notification is sent to the 5 nearest people and by clicking the notification route to the panicked user is drawn.
- An automatic audio recording happens for 2 minutes and is sent to the server.
- SMSs will be sent to 5 people (*these numbers will be saved while registering an accout in the app*) with position of the panicked user.
- A push notification to the Police admin will also be sent, which will have route and the audio file.

### Motivation :
Mobile Apps in this domain have been failing considerably in providing a quick trigger action at the moments of need, while IoT devices make it a lot harder to reach to public as people need to buy and carry that extra thing with themselves, which made us think to come to a solution and we managed preety well.

### Build status : 
- Prototype Stage (Almost Complete)
- Production Stage (Not Started)

### Built with :
Java, Android Studio.

### Features :
**BeSafe** is an app in the human security domain targetted mainly for women and kids. The app is 1st of its kind Android application that provides a **Super Quick trigger** at the moment of panic with just three shakes, it sends a notification to the 5 nearest people to the user and while we click at the notification a map opens which displays the route to the user panicking. Simultaneously, it sends an SMS to the user's family members and also a notification to the police, it also starts an audio recording in the background which also acts as an evidence. 


### Future prospects :
**Aadhaar Api** would be integrated for the account sign in, which will help to know the users better and a user having any antisocial activity can be reported and be removed from the App
The audio recording will be simultaneously uploaded to the **Google drive** link and the link will be sent to the family members and police via SMS. There will be an admin app at the end of the police.

### Code practices followed:
A good readability of the code has been kept in the mind and has been implemented by using the **Google developer's** best practices by Google.
The UI has been Built by following the designing rules of **Georgia Tech** and **University of California**, San Diego.
**Heuristic evaluation** of the App is done timely and is been improving after every evaluation, thus enhancing the User-Experience.
