# BeSafe

**BeSafe** is a Super Quick Android Application that provides human security for its app users in the real world. **3 single shakes** of a mobile phone will trigger the app to its main functioning. The app has its target audience as **women and kids** , but it's open to all and can help to prevent certain crimes such as burglary, kidnapping, theft, etc.

### Motivation :
We as technologists realized a lack of quick action of the app in this domain which drove us to make the product.

Prototype Stage (Almost Complete)
Production Stage (Not Started) 

### ScreenShots :

### Tech used :
Java, Android Studio.

### Features :
**BeSafe** is an app in the human security domain targetted mainly for women and kids. The app is 1st of its kind Android application that provides a Super Quick trigger at the moment of panic with just three shakes, it sends a notification to the 5 nearest people to the user and while we click at the notification a map opens which displays the route to the user panicking. Simultaneously, it sends an SMS to the user's family members and also a notification to the police, it also starts an audio recording in the background which also acts as an evidence. 


### Future prospects :
**Aadhaar Api** would be integrated for the account sign in, which will help to know the users better and a user having any antisocial activity can be reported and be removed from the App
The audio recording will be simultaneously uploaded to the **Google drive** link and the link will be sent to the family members and police via SMS. There will be an admin app at the end of the police.
